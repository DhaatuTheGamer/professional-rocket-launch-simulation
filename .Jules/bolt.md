## 2024-05-23 - Entity Serialization Optimization
**Learning:** The physics engine uses a SharedArrayBuffer for zero-copy communication, but the serialization/deserialization step (`postState` in worker, `syncView` in proxy) was using extensive `instanceof` checks to map class instances to integer IDs. This O(N) type checking (where N is number of subclasses) in a hot loop (every frame * every entity) adds up.
**Action:** Implemented a `readonly type` property (enum) on the base `Vessel` class and overrode it in subclasses. This replaces the `instanceof` chain with a single property access, significantly reducing overhead in the serialization hot path. Future entity types should follow this pattern.
