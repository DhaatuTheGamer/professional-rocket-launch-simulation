## 2026-02-13 - Keyboard Shortcuts & Safety
**Learning:** Resolving keyboard shortcut conflicts (e.g., FTS Arm vs SAS Toggle) is critical for UX, especially when the conflicting action is destructive (Arming Self-Destruct). Chorded shortcuts (e.g., `Alt+T`) add a safety layer for such actions and free up single keys for frequent non-destructive toggles.
**Action:** Always verify existing shortcuts (grep) and consider safety implications of single-key bindings for critical systems.
